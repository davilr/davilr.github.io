<h2>FAQ</h2><br>

<h4>ARE YOUR AGREEMENTS REALLY MONTH-TO-MONTH?</h4><br>

Yes. Our flexible month-to-month commitment provides you with the stability of an office along with the flexibility you need to grow your business.<br><br>

<h4>WHAT DOES AN OFFICE SPACE AT JUSTCO INCLUDE?</h4><br>

<h6>FURNITURE</h6><br>

Your JustCo office includes desks, chairs, desk lamps, and lockable filing cabinets. For some, that's all one needs. You're also welcome to bring in additional or alternate furniture. Contact your JustCo community manager if you intend to make changes to the setup and they'll help make it happen.<br><br>

<h6>SUPER FAST, RELIABLE INTERNET</h6><br>

Your office has both hard-wired (Ethernet) connections as well as access to WiFi. Private IP addresses and server storage are available at an additional cost.<br><br>

<h6>CONFERENCE ROOM TIME</h6><br>

Your office comes with conference room credits that correlate with your office size. You can book online or on-the-go with our mobile app. These credits can be used at all JustCo locations worldwide!<br><br>

<h6>JUSTCO MEMBER NETWORK</h6><br>

Connect with other members through our online community. Ask questions, share stories, announce product launches and other good news. Use it to invite others to events, promote your job listings, or simply find someone to grab a beer with. It's a great way to start meaningful relationships with creative entrepreneurs and business leaders.<br><br>

<h6>PRINTS / COPIES / UNLIMITED SCANNING</h6><br>

Each JustCo floor has at least one multi-function copier/scanner/printer. Your membership comes with 120 black & white copies and 20 color prints (or copies) per desk.<br><br>

<h6>UTILITIES / TAX</h6><br>

Your license fee includes both tax and utilities. Use that extra money to take your team to lunch!<br><br>

<h6>COFFEE</h6><br>

Coffee is fuel for connection, creativity, and collaboration. Ours is Stone Street – fair trade and micro-roasted in Brooklyn.<br><br>

<h6>AMENITIES AND EXTRAS</h6><br>

From Xbox consoles to meditation rooms, pool tables to bocce ball courts, and even karaoke rooms - you will find that all JustCo buildings have a fun mix of amenities.<br><br>

<h6>UNIQUE, EXCITING JUSTCO EVENTS</h6><br>

JustCo is a community of industry leaders and innovative entrepreneurs. Meet and connect with like-minded people and established companies at our weekly and monthly events. Check out some of our past events to learn more!<br><br>

<h6>ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THROUGH TRINET</h6><br>

JustCo members are eligible for discounted health care and HR solutions with our partner, TriNet. Learn more about getting Fortune 500 benefits for your team at justco.com/health.<br><br>

<h4>CAN I STOP IN OR SHOULD I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT?</h4><br>

Tours must be scheduled in advance. This ensures our availability and helps our team focus on helping you choose the right JustCo space. Give us a call at 877.818.5284 or click the "Schedule a Tour" on this page.<br><br>

<h4>DO ALL AGREEMENTS BEGIN ON THE 1ST OF THE MONTH?</h4><br>

Yes. Our 30-day move out policy requires move out on the last day of the month allowing the new member to move in on the 1st of the month. If this day lands on a weekend, arrangements will be made accordingly.<br><br>

<h4>WHAT IF I'M LOOKING FOR AN OFFICE MORE THAN 30 DAYS IN THE FUTURE?</h4><br>

We have a 30-day move out policy that lets us know office availability on the 1st every month. Example: If notice is given for a move out date on August 31st, this office can be reserved for someone new to move in September 1st. You may also be added to the waiting list for a different building of your choice within your time frame.<br><br>

<h4>HOW MUCH DO I NEED TO RESERVE AN OFFICE?</h4><br>

JustCo requires a deposit equal to a month and a half (1.5 months) when paying via ACH (auto withdrawal). If paying by credit card or wire transfer, JustCo requires a deposit equal to two and a half months (2.5 months) plus $100 setup fee per desk in order to reserve an office for your team.<br><br>

<h4>WHAT IF MY COMPANY NEEDS PHONE SERVICE?</h4><br>

Unlimited domestic VoIP phone service is provided through iCore at an additional $60/month per user. International calling services are available at an additional fee. If your team has VoIP phone service that you'd like to maintain, simply plug into the ports provided in your office at no additional fee.<br><br>

<h4>WHAT IS THE AVERAGE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF A JUSTCO OFFICE?</h4><br>

Every JustCo office is uniquely designed and differs per location. We typically measure in desk space with more than enough room for a team to work comfortably. Schedule a tour to check it out for yourself!<br><br>

<h4>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HOT DESK, SHARED DESK, LABS DESK, AND PRIVATE OFFICE?</h4><br>

<ul>
<li>A hot desk is an unassigned desk in a large open area. Phone calls must be made in phone booths and personal items must be taken home at the end of the day.</li>
<li>A shared desk is a dedicated desk in a private office with other members. A desktop can be set up and left overnight. This space is typically in a 4-6-person office and comes with a lockable filing cabinet for your personal belongings. Phone booths are available on all floors for calls.</li>
<li>A labs desk is an assigned work space in a large open area shared with many others. This dedicated space comes with a lockable filing cabinet for your personal belongings. Desktops may be set up and left overnight. Phone booths are available on all floors for phone calls.</li>
<li>A private office is a fully enclosed, lockable space built for a team of 1-10 people (or more). Your company can add on more offices as you grow. Speak to your community management team about custom built spaces for teams of 12 or more at one of our new locations!</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>WHAT ARE THE BUILDING HOURS? WHEN ARE YOU OPEN?</h4><br>

All JustCo buildings are accessible by keycard 24/7. JustCo staff attend to the buildings between 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. Monday through Friday.<br><br>

<h4>CAN GUESTS VISIT ME AT MY OFFICE?</h4><br>

We love to host your guests! Just make sure you register them in our easy online system or on the JustCo app and receive a text message when they arrive.<br><br>

<h4>AM I ALLOWED TO BRING MY DOG? WHAT'S YOUR PET POLICY?</h4><br>

Our pet policy varies by building. Please ask your JustCo community manager when you take a tour for the most up-to-date information. If you plan on bringing a pet to the building, you will be solely responsible for any injury or damage caused by your pet to other members or their property. JustCo is not responsible for any injury or damage to your pet should it occur in or around the building. In addition, any pet brought into a JustCo building must be vaccinated. We reserve the right to restrict your ability to bring your pet at our discretion.<br><br>

<h4>I'M READY TO SIGN UP! WHAT ARE MY PAYMENT OPTIONS?</h4><br>

You may pay by ACH (auto withdrawal), credit card or wire transfer. Note that wire transfers and credit card payments are subject to an additional deposit.<br><br>

<h4>WHEN DO I HAVE TO LET JUSTCO MANAGEMENT KNOW I'M MOVING OUT?</h4><br>

Members are required to give a 30-day notice to move out or transfer offices. Move out forms must be submitted by the last business day of the month prior to vacating. Example: If a member wants to move out on August 31st, they must give notice to JustCo management on July 31st.<br><br>

<h4>IS IT EASY TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER JUSTCO LOCATION?</h4><br>

Yes! If the building of your choice has availability, simply fill out your exit form for your current location. The security deposit from your previous office will be transferred and you'll pay the difference if you've moved to a larger space at the new location.<br><br>

<h4>I AM A CURRENT JUSTCO MEMBER AND LOVE MY OFFICE! DOES JUSTCO GIVE REFERRAL REWARDS IF I SEND A FRIEND TO A JUSTCO LOCATION?</h4><br>

We are happy to help your friends and colleagues! Our referral program rewards JustCo members with 10% off one month's license fee after their official move in along with 20% off the first month for the person referred.<br><br>

<h4>MY COMPANY HAS GROWN OUT OF ITS CURRENT SPACE. DOES JUSTCO BUILD SPACES FOR TEAMS LARGER THAN 12 PEOPLE?</h4><br>

JustCo is constantly growing and building new locations. If a building is under construction and can be altered to fit your company's needs, we're happy to help! As your team begins to grow, tell your community manager and we'll find the perfect space for you.<br><br>
